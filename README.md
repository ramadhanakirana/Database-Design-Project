# üìÑ Case
PT. Nusantara Building Industries is a national private company engaged in building materials industry activities. Currently, the company has more than 5000 employees working in various fields, including CEO, management, accountants, and technicians. To track each employee's ownership, a system is needed that can store basic information about each employee, such as the date of recruitment and the date of resignation from the company. In addition, information on the division of labor for each employee also needs to be known so that the division of labor is in accordance with their specialization.<br>
It was informed that the divisions owned by the company are spread across several locations in Indonesia. Making it possible for a division to be in more than one location, such as the distribution, sales, receiving, and payroll departments. Therefore, the company has more than one office building for each of its divisions. Information related to office buildings needs to be stored so that it is easier for companies to contact their employees in various divisions at different locations. <br>
In sales, PT. Nusantara Building Industries does not only sell finished products but also raw materials. Sales only serve retailers, not individuals. So to launch its business, the company cooperates with many suppliers of raw materials and logistics companies. To fulfill each order, the company needs to know from which suppliers raw materials must be ordered, prices, supplier contact information, and methods of delivery of goods.<br>
For every order of finished products/raw materials by a retailer, the system records the order quantity, the quantity sent, and information on how to send the goods (transportation). For goods delivery methods, it is necessary to know the logistics company's information, the type of shipping transportation used (land, sea, or air) and the percentage discount given by the company. This information is used to determine how the order will be sent to the retailer.<br>
